I’m thrilled to announce the launch of DataConnect Robotics—a new space where data, technology, and hands-on creativity come together.

### Why DataConnect Robotics?

This site is the home base for my ongoing adventures at the intersection of data analytics, robotics, and STEM education. Whether you’re a fellow tinkerer, a parent, an educator, or just curious about what’s possible with modern tools, I hope you’ll find something here to inspire you.

### What You’ll Find Here

- **Open Data Projects:**
Interactive dashboards and visualizations (like the [MA Public School Districts Dashboard](https://dataconnectrobotics.com/district-map.html)) that make public data more accessible, insightful, and fun to explore.
- **Robotics Builds & Experiments:**
Follow along as I design, build, and document real-world robotics projects—from simple bots to smart sensors, from classroom kits to ambitious DIY adventures.
- **STEM Education Resources:**
Practical guides, workshop ideas, and project plans for anyone interested in teaching or learning robotics, programming, and data skills—especially for kids and families.
- **Blog & Community:**
Thoughts, lessons learned, and honest stories from my journey in tech, teaching, and creative problem-solving.

### Who Am I?

I’m Nick Davidson—a consultant, builder, and lifelong learner with a background in physics, data analytics, and robotics. I started DataConnect Robotics to bridge my professional experience in analytics with my passion for making, teaching, and sharing knowledge. My goal is to empower others (especially the next generation) to build, explore, and ask great questions.

### What’s Next?

This launch is just the beginning. Over the coming months, I’ll be:

- Adding new dashboards and data tools,
- Sharing detailed robotics project guides (with code and parts lists),
- Rolling out resources for hands-on workshops and classes,
- And posting regular updates, tips, and reflections.

**Your feedback and ideas are always welcome!**
If you see something you like, have suggestions, or want to collaborate, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for stopping by and being part of this new adventure. Let’s build something great—together.

_— Nick Davidson_
